# Context

The shared language of this project. Glossary only — no implementation details,
no decisions, no specification. Decisions live in `docs/adr/`.

## Scene

The calm world on screen. The teacher chooses between seven Scenes: the
savanna, the coral reef, deep space, the prehistoric floodplain, the
forest, the jungle and the Arctic sea ice. A Scene
is a backdrop, its Ambient Life, the Roster of Creatures that can live in it,
and its Departure. Each
Scene keeps the Creatures it has earned separately, so switching never takes
any away.

## Creature

One animal that can appear in the Scene. Creatures are shy: they come out
while the room is Quiet and stay hidden while it is Too Loud. A Creature is
either **absent** or **present**. Once present, it stays present for the rest
of the Session, unless it Runs Away.

In deep space a Creature is not an animal but a **sighting**: something the
class's telescope picks up, from a satellite to a black hole. It is still a
Creature in every other way.

## Roster

The full list of Creatures a Scene can produce. The Roster is fixed; the
number of Creatures _present_ is not, because common Creatures can arrive more
than once.

## Rarity Tier

How likely a Creature is to be the next one to arrive: Common, Uncommon or
Rare. A Rare Creature may not appear at all in a given Session. Tier is a
property of the Creature; it never changes during a Session and is never
unlocked or gated.

## Ambient Life

Scenery that is alive but is not a Creature: swaying grass and drifting
clouds on the savanna, seaweed and plankton on the reef, twinkling stars and
drifting dust in deep space, ferns and river mist in the
prehistoric Scene, falling leaves and drifting motes in the forest, lianas, sunbeams
and a far waterfall in the jungle, the aurora, falling snow and bobbing
ice floes in the Arctic. Ambient Life is present from the first moment of
every Session, is never earned, and is never counted. It exists so an
unpopulated Scene still reads as a living place.

## Note

Words or a drawing the teacher puts on the Scene for the class to read,
drawn as part of the world: a cloud in the savanna sky, a framed wooden sign
hanging in the reef water, a readout panel floating in deep space, a slab of
sandstone with a fossil in its border in the prehistoric Scene, a trail sign
framed in logs in the forest, a board in a lashed bamboo frame hanging from
lianas in the jungle, a block of sea ice with a pane of packed snow and
icicles along its foot in the Arctic. Creatures pass behind a Note. A Note belongs to the
teacher and the Class, not the Session: Reset leaves it, and it stays where it
is when the Scene changes, taking on the new Scene's look. Each Class has its
own Notes.

## Arrival Rate

How much Quiet time buys one Creature. The teacher chooses it from named
presets or types a number of minutes. It is the only dial that changes how fast the Scene fills.

## Session

One stretch of classroom work, from the teacher pressing start to the teacher
resetting. A Session begins with an empty Scene and fills as the room stays
quiet. Refreshing the page does not end a Session; nothing about a Session
outlives Reset.

## Class

A group of students the teacher names, such as "2nd period". Each Class has
its own Creatures in every Scene, its own Collection, and its own Notes and
Timer, so one Class never sees what another earned or was told, and Reset
empties only the Class on screen.
Switching Class ends the Session until the teacher presses start again.
Deleting a Class removes everything it kept. There is always at least one.

## Quiet

The state of the room being at or below the Volume Goal. While the room is
Quiet, Creatures arrive, at the Arrival Rate.

## Too Loud

The state of the room being above the Volume Goal. In deep space, noise is
interference on the telescope's signal. While the room is Too Loud,
no new Creatures arrive — the shy animals wait to come out — and, by default,
the ones already out start to Run Away. A teacher can choose instead to pause
the Scene, where nothing is taken away; arrival simply pauses and the Scene
holds still. A momentary sound — a knock at the door, a dropped book — is not
Too Loud.

## Run Away

What Too Loud does by default. The Scene freezes, and while the room stays Too
Loud, first a single Creature and then, every five seconds, a fifth of those
still present (at least one) are startled and leave, in the Scene's own
Departure. They are gone for the rest of the Session.

## Departure

How a Scene's Creatures leave when they Run Away. On the savanna, the
reef, the prehistoric floodplain, the forest, the jungle and the Arctic they are startled and **run** off the edge of the Scene. In deep space
they **fade out**: each one stays where it is and breaks up into static, like
a signal lost to interference. Only the look differs: which Creatures leave,
and when, is the same in every Scene.

## Paused

The teacher has stopped the app listening for a while, say to make an
announcement. Nothing is judged while Paused: no Creature Runs Away, none
arrives, and the Scene stays clear. Not to be confused with choosing to pause
the Scene when it is Too Loud, which is about how the Scene reacts to noise.

## Volume Goal

The sound level the class is aiming to stay under. The teacher sets it, either
by choosing a named preset or by adjusting it directly.

## Calibration

Teaching the app what this particular room and microphone sound like, by
sampling the room while it is silent and again while it is talking normally.
Calibration is optional; without it the app uses a sensible default.

## Timer

A countdown the teacher can put up over the Scene and drag wherever suits
the room. Creatures pass behind it. When it runs out it chimes, and while the
chime rings the room is not judged: the teacher's own bell is never Too Loud
and never makes a Creature Run Away. Each Class has its own Timer: switching
Class pauses the one on screen, and it waits for that Class to come back.
Changing Scene leaves it running.
