   * Scenery that is alive but is not a Creature: seaweed, coral, plankton,

   * It exists because an unpopulated reef otherwise reads as "this app is
   * broken" rather than "we have not earned anything yet" — at one arrival
   * every five minutes, that first stretch is long. Everything here is
   * deliberately subordinate: smaller, dimmer, lower contrast, and without the
   * signature eye that every Creature has.
   *
   * The artwork is `src/lib/scenes/reef/ambient/`; the scatter below is what
   * places it. Positions are fixed rather than random, so the reef looks the
   * same each time a teacher opens it.
