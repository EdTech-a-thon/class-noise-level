   * Scenery that is alive but is not a Creature: swaying grass, acacias,

   * far-off flock of birds in silhouette. Present from the first
   * second of every Session, never earned, never counted.
   *
   * It exists because an unpopulated safari otherwise reads as "this app is
   * broken" rather than "we have not earned anything yet" — at one arrival
   * every five minutes, that first stretch is long. Everything here is
   * deliberately subordinate: smaller, dimmer, lower contrast, and without the
   * signature eye that every Creature has.
   *
   * The artwork is `src/lib/scenes/savanna/ambient/`; the scatter below is what
   * places it. Positions are fixed rather than random, so the Scene looks the
   * same each time a teacher opens it.
