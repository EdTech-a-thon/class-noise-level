   * Scenery that is alive but is not a Creature: lianas swaying from the
   * canopy, ferns, palms, monstera and heliconia stirring on the forest
   * floor, sunlight slanting through a gap in the leaves with motes drifting
   * in it, mist hanging under the bough, the waterfall pouring far off and a
   * flock of parrots crossing in silhouette. Present from the first second of
   * every Session, never earned, never counted.
   *
   * It exists because an unpopulated jungle otherwise reads as "this app is
   * broken" rather than "we have not earned anything yet". Everything here is
   * deliberately subordinate: muted greens, lower contrast than the
   * Creatures, and without the signature eye that every Creature has. It is
   * also slow: this runs on a projector all day.
   *
   * The artwork is `src/lib/scenes/jungle/ambient/`; the scatter below is what
   * places it. Positions are fixed rather than random, so the Scene looks the
   * same each time a teacher opens it.
