/**
 * The reef artwork, as inlineable SVG source.
 *
 * The files are inlined rather than loaded through `<img>` because the
 * animation layer sways part groups by class (`part-tail`, `part-fin`, …), and
 * CSS cannot reach inside an `<img>`. Inlining is also why the art carries no
 * `id` attributes: every Creature on screen shares one document. See
 * `docs/svg-art-brief.md`.
 *
 * Eager, so the whole reef is in the first bundle. The set is ~55 KB of
 * markup before compression, and a lazy fetch would land exactly at the
 * moment an arrival has to be unmissable.
