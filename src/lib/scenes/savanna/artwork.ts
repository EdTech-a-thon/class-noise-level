/**
 * The savanna artwork, as inlineable SVG source. Loaded the same way as the
 * reef's (`scenes/reef/artwork.ts`), for the same reasons.
 *
 * The files are inlined rather than loaded through `<img>` because the
 * animation layer sways part groups by class (`part-tail`, `part-fin`, …), and
 * CSS cannot reach inside an `<img>`. Inlining is also why the art carries no
 * `id` attributes: every Creature on screen shares one document. See
 * `docs/svg-art-brief.md`.
 *
 * Eager, so a lazy fetch never lands at the moment an arrival has to be
 * unmissable.
