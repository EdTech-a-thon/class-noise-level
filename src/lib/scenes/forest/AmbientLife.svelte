   * It exists because an unpopulated wood otherwise reads as "this app is
   * broken" rather than "we have not earned anything yet". Everything here is
   * deliberately subordinate: smaller, muted, lower contrast, and without the
   * signature eye that every Creature has. It is also slow: this runs on a
   * projector all day.
   *

   * what places it. Positions are fixed rather than random, so the Scene
   * looks the same each time a teacher opens it.
