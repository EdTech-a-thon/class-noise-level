/**
 * Deciding when the room is Too Loud.
 *
 * Getting in works like a bucket filling up. Every moment over the goal adds
 * to it, and the further over, the faster it fills: a room just over the line
 * takes about six seconds, a room far over it takes one. Moments under the
 * goal drain it again, so a knock at the door or a dropped book leaks away
 * before it can count.
 *
 * Getting out is deliberately quicker and simpler: three quiet seconds, by
 * the mean. A class that settles gets an almost immediate reward rather than
 * a penalty box. See docs/adr/0001-nothing-is-taken-away.md.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no timers, no microphone, no stores. Everything here is a
 * function of the samples and the clock, which is what makes the hysteresis
 * testable without waiting real seconds.
