      "Shy Safari is a classroom noise monitor that runs in a web browser. Put it on the projector or interactive whiteboard and it shows a calm savanna, coral reef, night sky in deep space, Cretaceous floodplain or rainforest jungle. It listens to how loud the room is through the computer's microphone, and while the class stays under the volume goal, shy animals come out one at a time. It is the opposite of a bouncing noise meter: there is no score, no needle and no red warning light, so nothing makes being loud more interesting than being quiet.",
    "guide.useTitle": "Using it in class",
    "guide.use.open":
      "Open shysafari.com on the computer connected to your projector, pick the savanna, the coral reef, deep space, the prehistoric scene or the jungle, and press Start. The browser asks to use the microphone.",
    "guide.use.goal":
      "Set the volume goal for the activity: Silent, Independent (quiet whispers) or Partner work (conversation voices), or drag the line on the meter to anywhere in between.",
    "guide.use.rate":
      "Let the class work. The first animal appears after 10 to 20 quiet seconds, and after that about one every five minutes of quiet work. Choose Relaxed, Normal or Lively in Settings, or type any number of minutes.",
    "guide.loudTitle": "How it decides the room is too loud",
    "guide.loud":
      "Short noises, like a knock at the door or a dropped book, don't count. The room has to stay over the goal for a bit first: about six seconds if it's just over, or about one second if it's much louder. Once it quiets down, the scene clears within three seconds.",
    "guide.calibrate":
      "Calibration is optional. Five seconds of silence and five seconds of normal talking teach the app what your room and your microphone sound like.",
    "guide.tooLoudTitle": "What happens when it gets too loud",
    "guide.tooLoud":
      "The scene clouds over, with a dusty haze on the savanna, murky water on the reef, interference in deep space, mist off the river in the prehistoric scene and a tropical downpour in the jungle, and no new animals come out. What happens next is your choice:",
    "guide.tooLoud.flee":
      "Animals run away (the default). The scene freezes and, while the room stays too loud, one animal and then a few more every five seconds run off the edge of the screen. In deep space, they fade out into static instead.",
    "guide.tooLoud.pause":
      "Pause the scene. The animals hold still, nothing is taken away, and progress toward the next animal waits until the room is calm again.",
    "guide.animalsTitle": "The animals",
    "guide.animals":
      "The savanna has 17 animals, from meerkats and zebras to giraffes, hippos and rhinos, with lions, leopards and elephants as the rare ones. The coral reef has 18, from clownfish and seahorses to sea turtles and octopuses, with hammerhead sharks, manta rays and whale sharks as the rare ones. Deep space has 17 sightings for older students, from satellites, asteroids and astronauts to the space station, comets and Saturn-like planets, with a spiral galaxy, a black hole, a pulsar and a ring nebula as the rare ones. The prehistoric scene has 17 animals from the very end of the age of dinosaurs, drawn with up-to-date science, from small mammals, lizards and feathered raptors to Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, with Tyrannosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus and the giant Alamosaurus as the rare ones. The jungle has 17 rainforest animals, from poison dart frogs, toucans and capuchin monkeys to sloths, macaws and orangutans, with jaguars, gorillas and tigers as the rare ones. Common animals turn up often and rare ones are a real event that many sessions will not see at all. Each scene keeps its own animals, and the collection remembers every animal the class has spotted.",
    "guide.forTitle": "Who it is for",

    "guide.faq.free.a":
      "Yes. There are no paywalls, no ads and no premium version. It came out of the EdTech-a-thon, a community of builders making free tools for classrooms, and is maintained by teacher.dev.",
    "guide.faq.record.q": "Does it record the classroom?",

      "No. The microphone is used only to measure how loud the room is, as a single number, moment by moment, on your computer. Nothing is recorded, saved or sent anywhere.",
    "guide.faq.accounts.q": "Do I or my students need an account?",

    "guide.faq.devices.a":
      "A computer with a microphone and an up-to-date web browser such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari. Laptops, Chromebooks and interactive whiteboards all work. It is designed for a projector or large screen, but it runs on a tablet or phone too.",
    "guide.faq.languages.q": "Which languages does it support?",
    "guide.faq.languages.a":
      "English, Spanish and French. It follows the browser's language, and you can change it from the menu at the top of the screen.",
    "guide.faq.meter.q": "How is it different from a noise meter?",
    "guide.faq.meter.a":
      "A noise meter shows the class how loud they are, which can turn getting louder into a game. Shy Safari shows only a peaceful scene that slowly fills with animals, so the reward for quiet work is what the class sees, and there is no score to beat.",

      "Shy Safari es un medidor de ruido para el aula que funciona en el navegador. Ponlo en el proyector o en la pizarra digital y muestra una sabana, un arrecife de coral, un cielo del espacio profundo, una llanura del Cretácico o una selva tropical tranquilos. Escucha lo fuerte que suena la clase a través del micrófono del ordenador y, mientras la clase se mantiene por debajo del límite de volumen, van apareciendo animales tímidos uno a uno. Es lo contrario de un medidor de ruido que salta: no hay puntuación, ni aguja, ni luz roja de aviso, así que hacer ruido nunca resulta más interesante que estar en silencio.",

    "guide.loud":
      "Los ruidos cortos, como un golpe en la puerta o un libro que se cae, no cuentan. La clase tiene que pasarse del límite durante un rato: unos seis segundos si se pasa un poco, o alrededor de un segundo si hay mucho más ruido. Cuando vuelve la calma, la escena se aclara en tres segundos.",

    "guide.tooLoud.flee":
      "Los animales huyen (la opción por defecto). La escena se congela y, mientras siga habiendo demasiado ruido, un animal y luego unos cuantos más cada cinco segundos salen corriendo de la pantalla. En el espacio profundo, en cambio, se desvanecen entre la estática.",

El arrecife de coral tiene 18, desde peces payaso y caballitos de mar hasta tortugas marinas y pulpos, con tiburones martillo, mantarrayas y tiburones ballena como los más raros. El espacio profundo tiene 17 avistamientos pensados para estudiantes mayores, desde satélites, asteroides y astronautas hasta la estación espacial, cometas y planetas como Saturno, con una galaxia espiral, un agujero negro, un púlsar y una nebulosa anular como los más raros. La prehistoria tiene 17 animales del final de la era de los dinosaurios, dibujados según la ciencia actual, desde pequeños mamíferos, lagartos y raptores con plumas hasta Triceratops y Ankylosaurus, con Tyrannosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus y el gigantesco Alamosaurus como los más raros. La selva tiene 17 animales de la selva tropical, desde ranas venenosas, tucanes y monos capuchinos hasta perezosos, guacamayos y orangutanes, con jaguares, gorilas y tigres como los más raros. Los animales comunes aparecen a menudo y los raros son todo un acontecimiento que muchas sesiones no llegan a ver.

La préhistoire compte 17 animaux de la toute fin de l'ère des dinosaures, dessinés d'après la science actuelle, des petits mammifères, lézards et raptors à plumes aux Triceratops et Ankylosaurus, avec Tyrannosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus et le géant Alamosaurus parmi les plus rares. La jungle compte 17 animaux de la forêt tropicale, des grenouilles venimeuses, toucans et capucins aux paresseux, aras et orangs-outans, avec les jaguars, les gorilles et les tigres parmi les plus rares.
