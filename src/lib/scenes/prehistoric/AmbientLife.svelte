   * Scenery that is alive but is not a Creature: ferns stirring, dawn

   * the river, light glinting on it, a herd grazing far off on the other
   * bank and two pterosaurs in the haze. Present from the first
   * second of every Session, never earned, never counted.
   *
   * It exists because an unpopulated Scene otherwise reads as "this app is
   * broken" rather than "we have not earned anything yet". Everything here is
   * deliberately subordinate: muted, lower contrast, and the far animals are
   * flat silhouettes, so nothing is mistaken for a Creature. It is also slow:
   * this runs on a projector all day.
   *
   * The artwork is `src/lib/scenes/prehistoric/ambient/`; the scatter below is
   * what places it. Positions are fixed rather than random, so the Scene looks
   * the same each time a teacher opens it.

   * ground passes in front of some scenery and behind the rest — the same
