/**
 * Choosing which Creature arrives.
 *
 * Rarity is a weighted roll rather than a schedule, so a whale shark is a
 * genuine event that many Sessions will not see at all. Common and Uncommon
 * species may arrive more than once — that is what keeps a long work period
 * producing visible arrivals after every species has been seen. Rare species
 * appear at most once each.
 *
 * Pure: the caller supplies the random source, so the distribution is testable.
