/**
 * The Notes the teacher has put on the Scene, remembered on this computer.
 *
 * A Note is the teacher's, not the Session's: Reset leaves it alone, and it
 * stays put when the Scene changes, taking on the new Scene's look (a cloud
 * on the savanna, a sign on the reef, a readout panel in deep space, a stone
 * slab in the prehistoric Scene). Like the settings, it is localStorage
 * and nothing more.
 *
 * Positions and sizes are fractions of the screen, and drawn strokes are
 * fractions of their Note, so everything keeps its place when the window is
 * resized or the Note is stretched.
